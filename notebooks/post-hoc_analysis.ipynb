you', 'have But for me Im glad that I did have this neardeath experience because it changed me', 'and put me into the person who I am today and I can understand who I will be tomorrow in the', 'future

change', 'your life But let me continue with this story So because of my books my music', 'my ideas in general the businesses that I create and continuously to create', 'to the point that now these

people', 'live their lives People have lives that they live But at the same time you understand when', 'someones envious or you know when you feel when youre left out of certain things', 'Or when

through And not even just friendship I want to be a human being that can', 'impact someones life in a positive way because Ive had that experience and thats why I am the', 'way that I am And people cant grasp that Anyway so a few months ago in my girlfriend', 'of eight years I considered her my other half She left me to move to a different state with', 'her parents Now weve lived together for five or six years of our whole relationship So now', 'for me it feels like Im literally alone Sometimes we communicate but its not like that how it', 'used to be and things like that But I feel totally alone because of the envy the jealousy Now', 'if you would ask this person I was with for eight years you know she will tell you that Ive been', 'through fucking transformation because she was there She supported me you know and Im grateful', 'for her to be in my life So you know whatever shes going through thats what shes going through', 'you know and the fact that she moved to where she moved thats thats on her you know we all grow', 'So I feel that maybe that thats what she needs to do to grow So but going back to this shit', 'this a lot of this shit affected me a lot and it still does today because it makes me think about', 'you know what I did you know to these people in my life these older these people in the old', 'times And you know you start to get into consciousness and you start to learn that well', 'youre your vibration and your thoughts right You start the more you start to put yourself on a', 'certain vibrational level you start to attract the certain people in your life and the people who', 'are not on that wavelength or not on that frequency start to vanish from your life So', 'a certain way because it makes me think about you know what I did or what if I did things', 'differently or if certain things are my fault or you know things like that And Im not always', 'looking for faulty situations like oh its that persons fault or this is why or different things', 'really change that unless you go within And by me making this video it allows me to go within', 'myself and to figure out you know not from a faulty perspective you know why I feel this way', 'So a lot of these things they affect me as much as my neardeath experience affected me', 'And surprisingly which the neardeath experience actually helped me you know build me up more', 'understanding about life And so I wasnt so hurt And Im still not so hurt about the envy or', 'being left alone being left out But these things do impact me in that way it does', 'But now I find myself even more like alone left out poorly treated Its like people look at me', 'differently which actually hurts a persons selfesteem Now more than it would have in the past', 'because of my fucking mentality You know it hurts more because Im more empathetic I can feel more', 'things I can feel and understand why Im feeling these things Thats all for my notes', 'So Im going to continue going on about this whole experience But you know today', 'in todays times in my life its like you know a lot of the times I try to', 'express myself to newer people that come into my life or just new people that I meet they see', 'that like oh hes mysterious or theyre curious you know because of the neardeath', 'experience thats part of that Im curious to my own fucking self So its nothing new in that', 'sense But at the same time you know I kind of used that to an advantage to help influence others', 'in a positive way you know So if you find me mysterious good I find my own fucking self', 'mysterious sometimes Matter of fact more than I should But thats a good thing because then', 'it caused me to seek the mysterious shit I like mystery I like not knowing And thats the whole', 'point of knowledge Its to not know But then its your acquisition How do you want to know', 'Do you want to know You know thats for myself hell yeah I want to know who the fuck I am', 'You know I dont want to just say okay Im here in this life and thats it You know', 'pay bills and then you die No hell no So for me its just about trying to figure out you know', 'who I am And I reflect a lot about you know who I am And getting rid of that', 'egoic perspective I do take mushrooms magic mushrooms The magic must I take psychoactive', 'plants and just put it that way I take psychoactive plants I use

in this box right I feel like Im an', 'energy being put into a box The energy flows It keeps going You cant fucking grasp that shit', 'I am chaos when it comes to understanding what the fuck chaos is
